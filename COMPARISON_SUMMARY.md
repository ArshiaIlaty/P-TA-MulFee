## Recommendations

### üéØ For Production Use

**Primary Recommendation**: Use the **Normal GPT-2 approach** for most applications because:
- Better overall utility preservation (98.6% for Random Forest)
- Higher data retention rate (72.9% vs 46.7%)
- More consistent performance across different model types
- Simpler and more reliable training pipeline

### üî¨ For Research Applications

**Consider Hierarchical Approach** when:
- Using Logistic Regression or other linear models
- Need for multi-level quality assessment
- Researching advanced discriminator architectures
- Working with specific feature correlations

### üöÄ Future Improvements

2. **Enhanced Hierarchical Training**: Improve data retention while maintaining quality
3. **Model-Specific Optimization**: Tailor approach based on target model type
4. **Advanced Discriminators**: Further refine hierarchical discriminator architecture

## Conclusion

While the hierarchical approach shows promise for specific use cases (particularly with Logistic Regression), the **normal GPT-2 approach currently provides better overall performance** for synthetic diabetes data generation. The normal approach achieves:

- ‚úÖ Higher utility preservation (98.6% vs 86.2% for Random Forest)
- ‚úÖ Better data retention (72.9% vs 46.7%)
- ‚úÖ More consistent performance across model types
- ‚úÖ Simpler and more reliable implementation

The hierarchical approach demonstrates technical innovation and shows potential for specific applications, but requires further optimization to match the practical effectiveness of the normal approach.

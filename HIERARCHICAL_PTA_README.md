# Hierarchical Discriminators and Multi-Level Feedback for P-TA

## Overview

This implementation adapts the "Hierarchical Discriminators and Multi-Level Feedback" concept to work with our GREAT-based P-TA architecture instead of PPO. The system provides fine-grained feedback at multiple levels to improve synthetic data quality.

## Key Innovation

Instead of using PPO with hierarchical reward models, we've implemented:

1. **Multi-Level Discriminators**: Token, sentence, row, and feature-wise discriminators
2. **Hierarchical Feedback Integration**: Feedback from all levels guides GREAT training
3. **Quality-Based Filtering**: Only high-quality synthetic samples are retained
4. **Enhanced Classifier Training**: Classifier benefits from hierarchical feedback

## Architecture Components

### 1. Token-Level Discriminator
- **Purpose**: Evaluates individual token plausibility
- **Architecture**: LSTM-based with embedding layer
- **Input**: Tokenized text sequences
- **Output**: Token quality score (0-1)

### 2. Sentence-Level Discriminator
- **Purpose**: Evaluates complete feature-value pairs
- **Architecture**: BERT-based with custom classifier
- **Input**: Individual feature sentences (e.g., "age is 45")
- **Output**: Sentence plausibility score (0-1)

### 3. Row-Level Discriminator
- **Purpose**: Evaluates complete data rows
- **Architecture**: BERT-based with deeper classifier
- **Input**: Complete formatted rows
- **Output**: Row-level quality score (0-1)

### 4. Feature-Wise Discriminators
- **Purpose**: Evaluate specific feature combinations
- **Architecture**: MLP-based classifiers
- **Features**: 
  - `age_bmi`: Age and BMI relationship
  - `glucose_hba1c`: Blood glucose and HbA1c correlation
  - `hypertension_heart`: Hypertension and heart disease
  - `smoking_diabetes`: Smoking and diabetes relationship

## How It Works

### Training Pipeline

1. **Initial GREAT Training**: Standard language model fine-tuning
2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generate initial synthetic samples
3. **Discriminator Training**: Train all discriminators on real vs synthetic data
4. **Enhanced GREAT Training**: GREAT model learns from hierarchical feedback
5. **Quality Filtering**: Only retain high-quality synthetic samples
6. **Final Generation**: Generate final synthetic dataset

### Multi-Level Feedback Process

```python
# Get feedback from all discriminators
feedback = hierarchical_discriminators.get_multi_level_feedback(generated_text)

# Calculate weighted quality score
quality_score = (
    feedback['token'] * 0.2 +           # Token-level weight
    feedback['sentence'] * 0.3 +        # Sentence-level weight
    feedback['row'] * 0.3 +             # Row-level weight
    np.mean(list(feedback['features'].values())) * 0.2  # Feature-level weight
)
```

### Integration with GREAT Training

Instead of PPO's policy gradient updates, we use:

1. **Combined Loss Function**:
   ```python
   # Standard language modeling loss
   lm_loss = great_model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=input_ids).loss
   
   # Hierarchical feedback loss
   feedback_loss = weighted_feedback_loss
   
   # Combined loss
   combined_loss = lm_loss + 0.1 * feedback_loss
   ```

2. **Quality-Based Sampling**: Only high-quality synthetic samples are used for training

3. **Enhanced Classifier**: Classifier training incorporates hierarchical weights

## Key Advantages Over PPO Approach

# Balanced Evaluation Analysis: Hierarchical vs Normal GPT-2 Approaches

## Executive Summary

This analysis addresses the critical **class imbalance issue** in the diabetes dataset and provides a comprehensive comparison between hierarchical and normal GPT-2 approaches using proper balancing techniques. The results reveal important insights about model performance when dealing with imbalanced data.

## Class Imbalance Problem

### üìä Dataset Imbalance Analysis

**Real Diabetes Dataset:**
- **Class 0 (No Diabetes)**: 91,500 samples (91.5%)
- **Class 1 (Diabetes)**: 8,500 samples (8.5%)
- **Imbalance Ratio**: 10.8:1 (Severely imbalanced)

**Synthetic Datasets:**
- **Hierarchical**: 89.4% vs 10.6% (8.4:1 ratio)
- **Normal**: 89.6% vs 10.4% (8.6:1 ratio)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems with Imbalanced Data

1. **Model Bias**: Models tend to predict majority class
2. **Misleading Metrics**: High accuracy but poor minority class performance
3. **Overfitting**: Models learn majority class patterns too well
4. **Poor Generalization**: Fails on minority class examples

## Balancing Techniques Applied

### üîß Techniques Tested

1. **Class Weights**: Adjusts loss function to give more importance to minority class
2. **Oversampling**: Duplicates minority class samples to balance dataset
3. **Undersampling**: Reduces majority class samples to match minority class
